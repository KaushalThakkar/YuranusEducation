                                <p class="text-justify">A New Zealand education teaches students to ask questions and
                                    think critically. The teaching style offers practical, hands-on learning, giving you
                                    the skills, you need for the future of work.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Affordable Education And Low Cost of Living </h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">Studying abroad can be an expensive affair. However, one of the
                                    benefits of studying in New Zealand is its affordable living. University costs
                                    differ based on courses. But, it can be easily balanced with a part-time job. To
                                    support your tuition fee, you may need about NZD 22,500 - NZD 36,000 annually, based
                                    on what you choose to pursue.

                                    <h4>Easy Entry Requirements </h4>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Unlike many other countries, New Zealand universities do not
                                        have a lot of competition to get admitted for a university degree.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">That is because the New Zealand government has invested
                                        heavily in higher education over the years. Because of that, New Zealand
                                        universities have more capacity than the number of students. Students with
                                        moderate grades can get entry into most Bachelor's degree programs easily.
                                    </p>
                                    </div>

                                    <p class="text-justify">Hence the entry requirements are minimal compared to most of
                                        the top universities in the world.
                                    </p>

                                <h4>A Great Place to Live & Study </h4>
                                <p class="text-justify">International students are welcomed warmly in New Zealand

                                    New Zealanders citizens are well-travelled and are interested in people from other
